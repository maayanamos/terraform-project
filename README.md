# Terraform Project Deploying AWS Infrastructure

This project automates the provisioning of AWS infrastructure using **Terraform**.
It includes a VPC, EC2 instance with Nginx, a public S3 static website, and an IAM user for fine-grained access control.

---

📦 Modules Included

- **VPC** – Custom Virtual Private Cloud with a public subnet.
- **EC2** – Web server deployed with Nginx and a custom `index.html`.
- **S3** – Static website hosting for an HTML file.
- **IAM** – User creation and secure access key handling using profiles.

---

Highlights & Features

- Uses **Terraform modules** to keep the code modular and reusable.
- Automatically creates and configures an IAM user and writes credentials to `~/.aws/credentials`.
- S3 bucket is configured with public access (for website) while still disabling ACLs.
- `user_data` installs and configures Nginx on instance launch.
- Clean `.gitignore` to avoid uploading sensitive or heavy files (like `.terraform/` and state files).
